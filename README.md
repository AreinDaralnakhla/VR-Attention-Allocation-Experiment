This experiment explores attention allocation in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on how users interact with dynamic objects under time constraints. 
Specifically, it examines whether movement patterns or the spatial position of spheres attract more attention during a VR experiment.
Users interact with 7 spheres per scene, each sphere has a distinct movement pattern (e.g., jitter, circular, or back-and-forth), across 10 main scenes repeated 7 times. 
The experiment logs user interactions, including click time, peripheral angles, distances, and movement type of clicked sphere, to evaluate behavioral trends.

This repo provides only the Unity scripts.
